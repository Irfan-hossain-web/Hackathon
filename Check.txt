If you attach a string to search filter on ng-repeat directive, it would search for that string in all rows. If you 
attach a function to search filter on ng-repeat directive, it implicitly calls the function for every repetition of 
table row (or each employee model) passing the row data as an argument (item variable in our case). If the function 
returns true, the row would be shown. Otherwise, false. If you specify "true" for the filter at ng-repeat directive 
level, it would not work (as that should be done for each repeated tr).
